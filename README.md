Develop an online service that will allow users to browse information about IGC files. IGC is an international file format for soaring track files that are used by paragliders and gliders. The program will not store anything in a persistent storage. Ie. no information will be stored on the server side on a disk or database. Instead, it will store submitted tracks in memory. Subsequent API calls will allow the user to browse and inspect stored IGC files.

It is missing GET /api/igc/id/field.
